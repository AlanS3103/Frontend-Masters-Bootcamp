        <h1>How is Keanu Reeves?</h1>
        <p>
            <img src="https://placekeanu.com/300/300/" alt="Keanu Reeves!" class="floatleft" />Keanu Reeves, the
            enigmatic actor we all love, has a heritage as
            diverse as his film roles. He was born in Beirut, Lebanon, to an English
            mother and an American father, with Chinese, Hawaiian, and Portuguese
            roots in the mix. It's safe to say he's a true global citizen.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite personal tragedies, Keanu's spirit remains unbroken. Losing his
            dear friend, River Phoenix, and experiencing the stillbirth of his
            daughter, Ava Archer Syme-Reeves, were painful chapters in his life.
            However, his dedication to his craft and his philanthropic efforts
            continue to inspire us all.
        </p>

        <p>
            You probably know Keanu best as Neo in "The Matrix" series. What sets
            him apart here is his commitment to realism. He trained extensively in
            martial arts and did many of his own stunts, giving those action scenes
            an unmatched authenticity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond the glitz and glamour, Keanu is known for his generosity. He's
            donated a substantial chunk of his earnings to various causes and even
            surprised the special effects and costume design teams on "The Matrix"
            with hefty bonuses. A true philanthropic soul.
        </p>

        <aside>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"You are Breathtaking."</p>
                <cite>Peter Sark to Keanu Reeves, "E3 2019, Cyberpunk 2077"</cite>
            </blockquote>
        </aside>

        <p>
            But did you know Keanu's got a thing for motorcycles? He's a co-founder
            of the Arch Motorcycle Company, indulging his passion for two-wheeled
            adventures. It's a unique side hustle for a Hollywood star.
        </p>

        <p>
            Oh, and he's ventured into the world of literature too. Keanu
            co-authored a children's book called "Ode to Happiness" with illustrator
            Alexandra Grant. It's a heartwarming read that showcases his creative
            range.
        </p>

        <p>
            What's really remarkable about Keanu, though, is his humility. Despite
            the fame, he remains one of the most down-to-earth and respectful actors
            in the business. In an industry often known for egos, Keanu stands out
            as a beacon of authenticity.<br /><img src="https://placekeanu.com/200/300/yg" alt="More Keanu Reeves!"
